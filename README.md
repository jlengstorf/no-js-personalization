# Personalized UIs with No Client-Side JavaScript

This is an experiment with [Netlify Edge Functions](https://www.netlify.com/blog/announcing-serverless-compute-with-edge-functions/?utm_source=readme&utm_medium=github&utm_campaign=devex-jl) to show how we can create adaptive UIs without client-side JavaScript.

This example uses Edge Functions to set and read a cookie. 

- Every time the user navigates to a new page on the site, the cookie is updated with a score for the type of content that was visited
- The score reflects an assumed interest in that category of content (more clicks === more interest is the assumption)
- When the home page is loaded, products are sorted so the most interesting show up first based on the user's current score
